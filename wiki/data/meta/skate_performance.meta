I've had a few chances to get some hard data on the boat's performace. I took a handheld, old, non waterproof GPS out a few times in 2007, but didn't get any tracks out of it, I was just happy to see the boat go over ten knots. Laurent started to bring his more modern GPS, which he could download into an Excel spreadsheet. I found that one good way to look at the data is to chart it as boatspeed on the x axis and course on the y axis. The first such chart I made is from April 2008:";}s:8:"relation";a:1:{s:10:"firstimage";s:24:"kevin:skate:sailing0.jpg";}s:11:"contributor";a:1:{s:4:"tdem";s:16:"Thomas de Meijer";}}s:10:"persistent";a:5:{s:4:"date";a:2:{s:7:"created";i:1365755043;s:8:"modified";i:1365755544;}s:7:"creator";s:16:"Thomas de Meijer";s:4:"user";s:4:"tdem";s:11:"last_change";a:7:{s:4:"date";i:1365755544;s:2:"ip";s:15:"222.152.144.187";s:4:"type";s:1:"E";s:2:"id";s:17:"skate_performance";s:4:"user";s:4:"tdem";s:3:"sum";s:0:"";s:5:"extra";s:0:"";}s:11:"contributor";a:1:{s:4:"tdem";s:16:"Thomas de Meijer";}}}
