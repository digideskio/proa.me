I am currently building a 18' plywood/epoxy proa in upper austria. I bought Gary Dierkings excellent book and wanted to build his T2 first. It would not be possible to finish the boat this year, because of the time consuming strip-planking build method. So I looked for a plan for a plywood proa and found Othmar Karschulin's P5 (free download on http://www.multihull.de/).

My proa is based on P5's bulkhead plan, but I streched the length from 5m to 5,5m. My boats design will be similar to Gary's pretty T2 (Marshall Islands).

I spent a week on modifying the plans and started building in May 2009.

I made scarf joints on the 4mm plywood parts using a circular saw.
