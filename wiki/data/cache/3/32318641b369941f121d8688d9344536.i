He protects you from danger, gazes soulfully into your eyes when you speak to him, and can’t wait to do what you ask him to do.  Dogs can certainly behave this way but many people don’t realize that it takes work to help your dog become the “perfect” dog.<br /><br />When you bring a clueless puppy home, he doesn’t know very much.  It’s up to you to train him and teach him to become your best friend.  If you want the perfect dog, then you have to help your dog know what you expect from him.<br /><br />This book, How To Raise The Perfect Dog, will show you how to go about teaching your dog everything he needs to know to become the perfect dog for you.  Not everyone has the same idea about what makes the perfect dog but there are certain things that most people agree upon when it comes to how puppies and dogs should behave.<br /><br />In this book you will learn how to choose the right puppy for your lifestyle.  You’ll learn how to tell if a puppy is healthy or not when you look at litters.  You’ll learn what vaccinations and healthcare a puppy needs when you bring him home with you.  And you’ll learn about the things you need to teach your puppy such as housetraining, crate training, and socialization.  In addition, How To Raise The Perfect Dog will tell you what to do about puppy behavior problems like nipping and jumping up on people.<br /><br />Dogs are called man’s (and woman’s) best friend for a reason.  They love us and will do anything for us.  Now it’s up to you to help your puppy grow up to be the best friend you want him to be.  We think this book will help you teach your puppy how to become the perfect dog.<br /><br />Keep reading and best of luck with your puppy.<br /><br /><br />Robert Grey here, I am pleased to let you know that my new book has a five star rating from the first person that bought it!<br /><br />You can if you wish, get the link to my book, by visiting this link ";}i:2;i:1;}i:3;a:3:{i:0;s:12:"externallink";i:1;a:2:{i:0;s:42:"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnzEYw73t3o";i:1;s:18:"How To Raise A Dog";}i:2;i:2123;}i:4;a:3:{i:0;s:5:"cdata";i:1;a:1:{i:0;s:6:"<br />";}i:2;i:2188;}i:5;a:3:{i:0;s:7:"p_close";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:2188;}i:6;a:3:{i:0;s:12:"document_end";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:2188;}}
