&lt;br /&gt;The price you pay to get a dog is just the start of what it takes to keep a dog.  Contrary to what many people think, a purebred dog from a good breeder is usually not as expensive as other ways of getting a dog.  A dog from a pet store can be very expensive.  Even a dog from an animal shelter or rescue can be fairly expensive these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have a dog, other costs will add up such as vet care (vaccinations, heartworm medication, flea prevention; possible spaying or neutering); grooming costs; dog food; boarding your dog or using a pet sitter if you go out of town; toys; dog training classes; and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your dog has allergies you will need special food that costs more.  If your dog has any health problems as he gets older, he will need added veterinary care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to estimates, it can cost between $700 and $3000 to keep a dog each year, depending on the size of dog you have and where you live.  It is usually more expensive to keep a large dog and it costs more to keep a dog in urban areas than in rural areas, in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Grey here, I am pleased to let you know that my new book is selling realy well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can if you wish, get the link to my book, by visiting this link <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnzEYw73t3o" class="urlextern" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnzEYw73t3o"  rel="nofollow">How To Raise A Dog</a>&lt;br /&gt;
