<strong>In The Beginning:</strong>
</p>

<p>
In late 2007 I decided to sail the inaugural <a href="http://www.texas200.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.texas200.com"  rel="nofollow">Texas 200</a>.
</p>

<p>
This was mostly predicated by looking at maps and at the wind rose for south Texas in June, and thinking longingly of endless broad reaches at 13 knots, with not a care in the world. Here&#039;s the route:

</p>

<p>
And here&#039;s the wind rose:

</p>

<p>
Woo hoo!
</p>

<p>
We got some of those endless long reaches, too, but first I had to get the boat in shape.
</p>

<p>
“I&#039;m going to sail the Texas 200,” I told my wife.
</p>

<p>
“That&#039;s nice, dear.” She was used to me going to sail around on lakes for a day. The &#039;200&#039; part didn&#039;t sink in for a few months.
</p>

<p>
“I&#039;m going to sail the Texas 200,” I told my friend Pete.
</p>

<p>
“Yeah you are,” he said, in a carefully neutral tone. It&#039;s possible Pete has been exposed to me declaring I was going to go sail another Watertribe race once too often, and has become jaded. Sad to be so cynical at such a young age.
</p>

<p>
“I&#039;m going to sail the Texas 200,” I told my proa sailing partner Laurent.
</p>

<p>
“Excellent! I can crew for you!” he said, taking me at my word. It&#039;s possible Laurent has not known me as long as Pete has.
</p>

<p>
So I got to work on the boat, and Laurent and I exchanged emails with lists of supplies and I looked at maps and calendars, the one providing inspiration, the other making my stomach feel funny. He, still taking me at my word, offered to make a new leeboard for the boat, the old one being too small by about half, and he bought a ticket back from his vacation a day early. Now I was committed! I had to have the silly thing done and ready to put in the water, he&#039;d finished the board and bought a ticket.
