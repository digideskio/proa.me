Google is a very good search engine. It&#039;s been in business since 2001 and is nowadays dominating the market. Other search engines like Yahoo, <a href="http://www.bing.com" class="urlextern" title="http://www.bing.com"  rel="nofollow">Bing</a> and others have a lot smaller share in the market. Hopefully that will change sometime soon in the future.
