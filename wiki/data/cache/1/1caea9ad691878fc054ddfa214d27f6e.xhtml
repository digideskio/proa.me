<p>
Based on works of Cz.Marchaj, on crabclaws sail execellent features, published in “Aerodynamics of Sailing”, I continued with my own research on this rig but in full scale. It was fruitfull effort.
</p>

<p>
Gathered old photos and drawings I&#039;ve started with model for concept proofing.
</p>

<p>
Model sailed unattended and, once set on tack, followed the wind changes without remote controll in somehow mystic way.
</p>

<p>
There was no reason to find out myself, what makes CrabClaws and proa such marvellous combination.
</p>

<p>
Model testing in aerodynamic tunnel is always limited  to some features and based on arbitrary made assumptions.
</p>

<p>
Full scale vessel allows for accurate sensing what happens, how and why - one can feel, and react, interactive build and test hypothesis, adapt the way observations are made.
</p>

<p>
I wanted real experience, so after collecting old drawings, with inspiration of Harmen Hielkema&#039;s “Toroa” and adviced by Gary Dierking, I prepared plans and built Pjoa.
