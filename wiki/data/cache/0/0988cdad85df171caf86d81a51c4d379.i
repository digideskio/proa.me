First impressions count, so a woman would be wise to feel and look her most desirable. A lady should be certain that her hair is styled and she is donning exquisite attire. Make-up should not be overdone, but subtle enough to make a difference. The instant a female leaves her front door, she should have done everything she can to thrill the male inside her heart. Dressing up to thrill makes a young lady feel spectacular and she will ooze inner confidence. Any time a woman comes across as being genuinely self-assured, she will attract men effortlessly without needing to try too rigorously.";}i:2;i:1448;}i:16;a:3:{i:0;s:7:"p_close";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:2095;}i:17;a:3:{i:0;s:6:"p_open";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:2095;}i:18;a:3:{i:0;s:5:"cdata";i:1;a:1:{i:0;s:831:"4) Guys are not only attracted to looks. It's important that the woman has looks, depth and individuality. Therefore, ladies would be wise to remember that the initial interest of a man, comes from a woman's disposition. Self-belief can be something that a majority of males are consumed by. Whenever a man first lays eyes on a woman, he would be attracted to her clothing, physical traits and self-belief. Women appear in a variety of sizes and shapes, guys are interested in the various models of women. A lady should take good care of herself. It isn't attractive for guys to see a woman that does not care about herself. Most men suspect that a woman has abandoned herself, if she isn't going to make the effort. Having said that, women must not be preoccupied with how they look.
