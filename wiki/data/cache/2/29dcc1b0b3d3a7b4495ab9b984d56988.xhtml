(CNN) – The Chinese government is sponsoring cyber-espionage to attack top U.S. companies, according to Grady Summers, vice president of security firm Mandiant.&lt;br /&gt;Virginia-based Mandiant published a 60-page report detailing allegations over a six-year period against a group of hackers – known as Comment Crew – which Summers linked to a secret division of the Chinese military.&lt;br /&gt;Summers told CNN: “China is attacking the U.S. on a scale like we&#039;ve never seen before… We believe that the Communist Party of China is very aware of this.”&lt;br /&gt;Read more: Have the courage to deal with cyber war&lt;br /&gt;Mandiant says the activity can be traced to four networks near Shanghai – with some operations taking place in a location that is also the headquarters of Unit 61398, the secret military division.&lt;br /&gt; Cracking down on Chinese hackers Firm: Many hackers attacking from China Report: Chinese Army behind cyber attacks U.S. cyber battle with China&lt;br /&gt;Summers added: “Never before have we seen one state-sponsored entity like unit 61398 of the Chinese PLA attacking helpless commercial organizations in other countries.”&lt;br /&gt;Read more: Chinese cyber attacks on West are widespread, experts say&lt;br /&gt;The espionage group mainly targeted U.S. blue chip companies in 20 separate industries from aerospace to financial services.&lt;br /&gt;“It&#039;s really a who&#039;s who of American companies. Of 140 victims worldwide, 115 of them were in the U.S.,” Grady said.&lt;br /&gt;Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei dismissed the hacking charges on Tuesday, insisting that China is the victim of many cyberattacks – most originating in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;“Making baseless accusations based on premature analysis is irresponsible and unprofessional,” he said. “China resolutely opposes any form of hacking activities.”&lt;br /&gt;Earlier this month, President Obama signed an executive order designed to address the country&#039;s most basic cybersecurity needs – and highlighted the effort in his State of the Union address.&lt;br /&gt;Summers says a cyber offence by the U.S. is not an appropriate response to the attacks as “it creates more problems than it solves.”&lt;br /&gt;Instead, he advocates better defense systems in organizations that are vulnerable to cyber attacks and diplomatic pressure from Washington on Beijing.&lt;br /&gt;The Mandiant report details 3,000 technical indicators including IP addresses, domain names and encryption certificates, that can be used to strengthen companies&#039; defenses.&lt;br /&gt;[<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/19/business/china-cyber-attack-mandiant/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5" class="urlextern" title="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/19/business/china-cyber-attack-mandiant/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5"  rel="nofollow">http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/19/business/china-cyber-attack-mandiant/index.html?hpt=hp_bn5</a> source]
