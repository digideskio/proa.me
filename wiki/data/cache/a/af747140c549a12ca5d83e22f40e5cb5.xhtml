Paul Bowker&#039;s deranged thoughts..
</p>

<p>
It has been suggested that Proas would be better with rocker. This is a few rough sketches and thoughts on how to build an assymetric stitch and tape proa with tortured ply.
</p>

<p>
This drawing is of building the main waka as a pair of hulls, so that the stresses of bending the curved sides are opposed, the inner seams and bulkheads and transoms would be fixed in place, then the two hulls separated down the centreline.
</p>

<p>
Each transom would be a mirror image so that the 2 halves are then bolted together to make a 20 ft waka. This would be a good kitset boat??
