Like all the others out there, both freeware together with shareware, Satellite Direct comes in place a bit short in some degree like all top brands out there.<br /><br />But nonetheless, many people worldwide continue to hunt for Satellite Immediate that gets roughly 29, 100 global monthly searches on Google with the search term alone. Nevertheless, this software service still is sold with some controversy that continues to spread like wildflower along the Internet.<br /><br />So what seems to be the issue? Some people complain that total number of HD (hi-def) channels for just about every country, as advertised, is usually incorrect. Yet, Satellite Direct briefly explains when reading their TOS (Words of Services) at their website there's no guarantee.<br /><br />I've purchased many products online through ClickBank and know for a fact they have an iron-clad money back guarantee policy, do give refunds : because I???ve received my money back, and if they find that a product or vendor in their marketplace is scamming consumers, they will immediately closed that vendor down.What I have noticed through research is actually that some users try to request refunds via e-mail to Satellite Direct, as soon as it's ClickBank that handles all sales and refunds.<br /><br />As for the lack of channels together with quality where complaints have been made, Satellite Direct has also an ???Update' icon that sits of their TV player console with screen. It allows you to update channels which should be the first thing the user should do after installing the TELEVISION player.<br /><br />Keep in mind that these issues are common to all or any top leading Internet TELEVISION software brands, some more than less. Unfortunately for Satellite Direct, it gets far more complaints. But the question that really needs to be answered is??? does this software really work or will it focuses on misleading potential buyers and taking their profit and run!<br /><br />Truth is Satellite Direct does work, but not all plenty of time for every computer. A lot of people are happy with it while others are not. I tend to feel that more people are very happy with this software service and there are a few video reviews that really show the Satellite Direct TV player for doing things, as well as the picture quality among other things.<br /><br />So the point recommendations that when searching for top level Internet TV software which delivers what's promised (as advertised) these products, whether free and paid, comes up short. It's a matter associated with someone who isn't on top of HD quality (naturally this is Internet TV and factors get play) and can purchase enjoyment when gaining instant access to tons of options online to watch a myriad of sports, TV shows, flicks, etc.<br /><br />No software, not Satellite Direct can create good on everything, yet this one is constantly on the remain on top as one of the most sought after Internet TV software packages around today. Love the idea or hate it, this software service/package is still something worth checking into.";}i:2;i:843;}i:5;a:3:{i:0;s:7:"p_close";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:843;}i:6;a:3:{i:0;s:12:"document_end";i:1;a:0:{}i:2;i:843;}}
