===== Description =====
In autumn of 2009 I started building a bigger proa for coastal cruising. My "boatyard" in the garden was very small and always "open air". Hence I designed a boat for fast and simple building in plywood and GRP. But nevertheless it took about a year to finish it. I also built by myself a 7 m mast from GRP and two 7m spars from carbon fibre. 

Both hulls are built from 6 mm plywood with 20x30 mm stringers. The hulls are completely covered by one layer of 200 gr fibreglass, and keels reinforced with one layer of 300 gram fibreglass. Beams are also made from plywood covered with 3 layers of 650 gram UD glass. The mast is made up of three 2,5 m GRP kernel sections each of 3 layers of 300 gram glass. These are then joined to make a 7 m mast kernel which is covered with 3 layers of 650 gram UD glass. Weight ca. 10 kg. Spars made of three 2,5 m GRP kernels of two layers of 300 gr glass then joined to 7 m kernels, and covered with 3-4 layers of 150 gr UD carbon. Weight each 3.5 kg. The rudder system is similar to the one Russ Brown used on Jzzero with two retractable rudders in dagger board cases.

First sail trials show that the boat is well balanced, and the rudders are working properly. Also a small outboard would added for coming back when there is no wind (paddling is possible, but very laborious :-)
