Also this time the transport solution is the same small car of the last year:

Wa'apa sailing at last!!

I can't test the long version; I had problems with the transport of the mid section. It 'll be for the next summer

In this photo the carrying solution with a small european Ford Fiesta:

One outrigger version: but I'm not a good sailor: at the first blow Wa'apa capsized! In this photo I'm trying to fit the mast: it's difficult with the wind blowing.

I immediatly returned to the trimaran version.

**These are the first photos I have: during the long laborius winter  I never did any.**

Here you can see the stern section, the first one almost completed.

In this photo you have an idea of how you can build a 7,20 m canoe in a garage of 5 m.

This other photo is for one of the outriggers (better it's a half outrigger because outriggers also are in two sections).

Near there are the rudder and the leeboard (the white thing).
