Satellite direct review-Okay, I bought this product myself and I was EXTREMELY skeptical that it was not going to work, that the quality would be lousy, or anything else that could go wrong... would. But, I was pleasantly proved otherwise.<br /><br />I didn't personally know anybody that purchased the product, so I took the chance. Here is what the product promises upon purchasing:<br /><br />**No Subscriptions or Monthly Fees<br /><br />**No Bandwidth Limits<br /><br />**You get 24/7 Unlimited Access<br /><br />**No Hardware to Install<br /><br />**You get Auto-Channel Updates<br /><br />**You get over 3,500 Channels from all countries across the world<br /><br />3,500 Channels. That was mind-boggling to me. I really didn't believe any of this. So I went ahead and purchased this. I got EXACTLY what was promised. No joke, the download was quick and simple. With everything accounted for, it took a couple of minutes to download... and that was it!I truly think it's amazing how far we have come with technology these days. Prior to purchasing this, I was paying about $120 per month for satellite service, and that did have any premium movie channels included.<br /><br />I can remember times of good old cable and just how fascinating that was. Now, times have changed. Satellite companies are banking on the average consumer, averaging well over $100 plus dollars a month. It's quite ridiculous.<br /><br />Not only have times changed, prices have right along with it. It seems the cost of everything has increased over the years.<br /><br />With the economy the way it is, and going through tough times, EVERY penny I can save counts. Erasing $120 per month for satellite service is wonderful to say the least. Score one for the consumers and user of [[http://satellitedirectreviewsy.com|Satellite Direct]]!<br /><br />All in All, as skeptical as I am about things, I think paying $49.95 one time is well worth it compared to paying monthly for satellite service. And, who are we kidding? Satellite services are NOT cheap!
