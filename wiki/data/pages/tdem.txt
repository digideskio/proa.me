Here are some pictures of a fully battened sail. The boat is a frostply we used to own, with an excellent racing record. Sailed fantastic.

[{{:tdem:dsc03263.jpg?400&direct|In no wind at all, here's what the sail looked like from the side in no wind.}}]

[{{:tdem:dsc03267.jpg?400&direct|And here looking up in a little puff. Notice the nice curves. With a bit more wind those wrinkles at the front would dissappear. The bottom batten was almost straight, and the rest curved.}}]

[{{:tdem:16.jpg?400&direct| Here's the sail trim to aim for in light winds. The top of the sail is allowed to twist off. Notice how the telltales on the leech are streaming at the top. If there is not enough wind to twist the sail, trim the top of the sail, don't worry about the bottom. The stronger wind is up high!}}]
