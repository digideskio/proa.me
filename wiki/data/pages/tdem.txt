Here are some pictures of a fully battened sail. The boat is a frostply we used to own, with an excellent racing record. Sailed fantastic. Click the images to enlarge

For a sail without a jib you may want the draft in the sail a bit further back.

[{{ :tdem:16.jpg?400&direct | Here's the sail trim to aim for in light winds. The top of the sail is allowed to twist off. Notice how the telltales on the leech are streaming at the top. If there is not enough wind to twist the sail, trim the top of the sail, don't worry about the bottom. The stronger wind is up high!}}]

SO, don't worry about some wrinkles, as long as the general shape of the sail is good. Wade, looks like your battens might be too stiff. It is also possible that the sail is just not cut with enough belly. The more you tighten up the battens, the more curve should be forced into the sail.

The battens on the frostply were about 5 mm by 20 mm, if I remember correctly, fibreglass. And tapering toward the front and back.
