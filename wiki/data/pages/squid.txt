Yay - I'm sailing again!!!!

Only five jobs on the work list and two of them are nothing. Biggest issue was I broke another tiller. I keep trying to use them as levers to raise the rudders, they are fine for steering the boat.

The new beams are stronger and stiffer, boat is still very fast - I was fantasizing about wing masts over the winter, but anything over 15kn and it is a bit scary anyway, might have to try the reefs one day.

Repairs are complete, but the forecast is 30-40 knots with thunderstorms this weekend .

Repairs are complete, just need i t to stop raining so I can paint, then another test sail to see what breaks next.

Although  we had a holiday in Aus a while back, the girls though this was funny

In fact we are planning the First New Zealand Proa Congress, Arkles Bay, Whangaparaoa, two weekends after Labour weekend, looks like 7boats could turn up, as Rob says - bigger than Texas. Anybody else want to join in?

**I'm in New Zealand!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

Here's a bit that I wrote afte rthe beams broke in Crew.org.nz
 
It didn't break under sailing forces. I went to shunt, which involves going beam on. I had the sails eased and was stationary. The small windward hull went way up in the air on a big wave and crashed back down, the beam cracked where it exits the bigger leeward hull, on the bottom of the beam. 

I dropped sail and sat there thinking about what to do. I was crippled and wouldn't be able to sail back into some 18 kn.

Eventually ( being a weekday no one else was out there) I called my beloved and organized a tow from the CG. My ego still hasn't recovered, in 45 years of sailing I've never had to ask for assistance before.

After a bit more wave action the beam broke completely, then it was only a matter of time till the other one went, so I got dragged into Shakespeare rather than go uphill, then had to disassemble Squid and bring her home on a trailer. She's back in the basement while I think about what to replace them with, maybe 4" aluminium tube??

That was going to be my last sail of the season as very soon I will be starting a new day job (don't worry, plenty of time for Crew.org.nz) and it p&^&*%^$%#$ me off for it to end like that.

Good news is it just keeps getting faster, I was flying.

I'll start with a few photos. The boat is currently back under the house getting new beams, but she went like shit off a shovel just before they broke
