====== Welcome to Wikiproa! ======

This site is intended to be a collaborative repository for articles on sailing proas, whether home or professionally built, modern or historical. For a definition of a 'proa', please see the wikipedia article [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proa|here]]. It's not intended to be a discussion site, since there's already an excellent proa discussion site on the web, the yahoo group proa_file, which is [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/proa_file/|here]].

So start a page, even a small one, tell us about your boat!  You can go back to edit and add pictures and so on as you have the time.
