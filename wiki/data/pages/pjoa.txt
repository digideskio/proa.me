====== "Pjoa" build by Janusz Ostrowski in Poland ======

Based on works of Cz.Marchaj, on crabclaws sail execellent features, published in "Aerodynamics of Sailing", I continued with my own research on this rig but in full scale. It was fruitfull effort.

Gathered old photos and drawings I've started with model for concept proofing.

Model sailed unattended and, once set on tack, followed the wind changes without remote controll in somehow mystic way.

There was no reason to find out myself, what makes CrabClaws and proa such marvellous combination.

Model testing in aerodynamic tunnel is always limited  to some features and based on arbitrary made assumptions.

Full scale vessel allows for accurate sensing what happens, how and why - one can feel, and react, interactive build and test hypothesis, adapt the way observations are made.

I wanted real experience, so after collecting old drawings, with inspiration of Harmen Hielkema's "Toroa" and adviced by Gary Dierking, I prepared plans and built Pjoa.
