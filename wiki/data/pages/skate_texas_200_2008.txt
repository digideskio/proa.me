**In The Beginning:**

  
In late 2007 I decided to sail the inaugural [[http://www.texas200.com|Texas 200]].

  
This was mostly predicated by looking at maps and at the wind rose for south Texas in June, and thinking longingly of endless broad reaches at 13 knots, with not a care in the world. Here's the route:

And here's the wind rose:

Woo hoo!

  
We got some of those endless long reaches, too, but first I had to get the boat in shape.

  
"I'm going to sail the Texas 200," I told my wife.

  
"That's nice, dear." She was used to me going to sail around on lakes for a day. The '200' part didn't sink in for a few months.

  
"I'm going to sail the Texas 200," I told my friend Pete.

  
"Yeah you are," he said, in a carefully neutral tone. It's possible Pete has been exposed to me declaring I was going to go sail another Watertribe race once too often, and has become jaded. Sad to be so cynical at such a young age.

  
"I'm going to sail the Texas 200," I told my proa sailing partner Laurent.

  
"Excellent! I can crew for you!" he said, taking me at my word. It's possible Laurent has not known me as long as Pete has.

  
So I got to work on the boat, and Laurent and I exchanged emails with lists of supplies and I looked at maps and calendars, the one providing inspiration, the other making my stomach feel funny. He, still taking me at my word, offered to make a new leeboard for the boat, the old one being too small by about half, and he bought a ticket back from his vacation a day early. Now I was committed! I had to have the silly thing done and ready to put in the water, he'd finished the board and bought a ticket.
