====== Leon's boats ======
===== January 2011: =====
The boat has finally been used for its designed purpose. I spent a week with the boat permanently rigged on the riverbank and went sailing, fishing and motoring every day. I spent a night on board in a little dome tent on the trampoline. The little Honda seems pretty good so far, but the bracket I built for it places it a bit too high. The motor puts a fair but of torque on the crossbeam, which it is not really designed for. This area will need some work. Overall, I remain happy with the boat. There are many refinements to be made, but these are all about reducing effort needed to transport, rig and sail the proa. Some pictures:

The boat on the riverbank. The paintwork/general finish looks good if you stay this far away.

These side-hung rudders were always going to be ugly and drag-creating, but they were quick to build and are fairly effective. The next proa will probably have something different however.

Loaded up with day-cruising gear.

This is fairly precarious, but the water was like glass so I got away with it a few times. I like keeping the open flame away from the foot-well, which could potentially hold some petrol fumes now that I have a motor.

 Urunga at dusk.

My rather inelegant camping setup. This was pretty functional. I learned that anchoring in very shallow water prevents you from sleeping because every wave bashes the boat against the bottom. You then have to get up at midnight and cut your hand on an anchor chain trying to move the boat in the dark.

Motoring up the Kalang river in a glassy calm. Very pretty, apart from the noise of an air-cooled outboard.

I took the proa for its second sail today. Light wind, crystal clear water.

I went sailing today, at the Bellinger River Sailing club which logically lies on the Kalang river, on the NSW north coast. Here are the photos, with notes. Let me know if my photos are too large or numerous and i'll economise.
